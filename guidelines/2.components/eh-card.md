#### Example Usage
##### Advanced Settings
An example with customized `ui` attributes for enhanced display:

Special cover effect can be applied to any <b>{{ $doc.constructorName }}</b>, allowing the main content to be 'hidden' from the first sight, while revealing itself only on hover over. Here is the list of possible combinations of cover options w/ effects:
| Type  | Transition  | Opacity  |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **Image** | 🎞️ Image w/ Transition | 🌫️ Image w/ Opacity |
| **Icon**  | 🎭 Icon w/ Transition | 🔳 Icon w/ Opacity |
| **Text**  | ✍️ Text w/ Transition | 📄 Text w/ Opacity |
