### Tone
* Practical
* Experience-based
* No “best practice” preaching

### Correct Framing for PubHub Guidelines

Each PubHub guideline should answer:

  “How do I achieve this standards outcome using PubHub?”

Examples:

* “Structuring Markdown for normative requirements”
* “Handling multi-dataset specifications”
* “Creating stable anchors for references”
* “Preparing content for HTML and PDF outputs”
* “Managing versioned releases”

The Markdown constructors are means, not the story.

Here are the guidelines for everything content creator (or anyone with a little bit of knowledge in web programming) might want to use. 

Here you can play with looks and feel of the website, how to color everything, which font to use, etc.

Also, here are custom components provided, with detailed instructions on how to use them, as well as some basic & advanced examples.

This section is constructed out of two sub-sections:
- [Looks&Feel](/guidelines/looks-feel/)
- [Components](/guidelines/components/)
