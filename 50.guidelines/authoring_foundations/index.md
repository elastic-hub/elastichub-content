## Context

Authoring is the foundation on which all publishing, review, and analysis depends.

Before tools are introduced, workflows defined, or outputs generated, standards organizations must establish **how content is written, structured, and reused**. These authoring decisions determine whether documents remain consistent, reviewable, and maintainable over time.

The Authoring Foundations provide a shared set of expectations for how content should be authored so it can be reliably published, reviewed, and reused across the organization.

---

## Purpose of Authoring Foundations

These guidelines exist to:

- Establish consistent authoring practices across documents and teams  
- Reduce ambiguity during review and approval  
- Enable predictable publishing outputs  
- Support reuse and long-term maintenance of specifications  
- Prepare content for tooling, automation, and analysis  

They are not intended to teach Markdown from scratch, nor to impose editorial style beyond what is necessary for clarity and consistency.

---

## Scope and Boundaries

The Authoring Foundations:

- Assume familiarity with GitHub Flavored Markdown  
- Focus on **how Markdown is used** in the context of standards and technical specifications  
- Define patterns and constraints that support reliable publishing  

They do **not**:

- Redefine Markdown syntax  
- Replace external Markdown documentation  
- Define governance, approval, or decision-making processes  
- Impose tool-specific behavior

## How to Read This Section

This section is organized from **foundational constructs** to **higher-level authoring patterns**.

You can approach it in different ways:

- Editors may read it sequentially to understand expectations  
- Program managers may reference specific sections during review  
- Chairs and leadership may use it to understand how consistency is maintained without bureaucracy  

Each page focuses on a specific aspect of authoring discipline.

## Markdown Foundations for Specifications

These pages document the subset of Markdown constructs that are commonly relied upon when authoring technical specifications.

They describe how to use:

- Text, headings, and paragraphs  
- Lists and nesting  
- Tables and structured data  
- Links and cross-references  
- Images and figures  

The emphasis is on **predictable structure**, not stylistic preference.

---

## Authoring Patterns for Standards Documents

Beyond syntax, technical specifications rely on recurring patterns.

These pages describe patterns such as:

- Section structure and logical ordering  
- Reusable and modular content  
- Practices that support efficient review and change tracking  

These patterns help teams scale authoring efforts across multiple documents and contributors.

---

## Single Source of Truth

Standards documents often reuse content across sections, documents, or versions.

The Authoring Foundations include guidance on **embedding and reusing content** in a way that preserves a single source of truth. This reduces duplication, prevents divergence, and improves long-term maintainability.

---

## Relationship to Elastic Hub Tools

Authoring Foundations are **tool-agnostic**.

They define expectations that are shared across Elastic Hub tools, including publishing, meeting support, and analysis capabilities. Tools rely on these foundations, but do not redefine them.

A dedicated section explains how these guidelines are used by Elastic Hub tools without making authoring dependent on any single tool.

---

## Why This Matters

Clear authoring foundations:

- Reduce friction during review  
- Improve consistency across releases  
- Enable automation without rework  
- Support long-lived specifications  
- Help organizations scale without adding bureaucracy  

They allow standards organizations to move faster while preserving quality and clarity.

## Summary

Authoring Foundations define **how content is written so everything else works**.

By establishing shared authoring expectations, organizations create a stable base for publishing, collaboration, and long-term stewardship of their specifications.

The pages that follow describe these foundations in detail, starting from Markdown constructs and building toward reusable authoring patterns.
